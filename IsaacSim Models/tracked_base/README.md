# Tracked Base Example for IsaacSim 4.5.0
Tracked base example model compatible with IsaacSim 4.5.0. Currently the model only has one track for testing the PhysicsScene settings.

## Changes from Previous Model (IsaacSim 4.2.0)
- Simplified model structure
- Flattened the model to one file for easier usage
- General solver settings

**Note:** This is still a work in progress, but should soon be usable in IsaacLab as well :)
